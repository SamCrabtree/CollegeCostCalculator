# College Cost Trend Analyst
A program that helps compare the cost of tuition and graduation rates between years to equip the user with an idea 
of trends. 

This project was made as part of a requirement for CodeLouisville's Data Analysis 2 program and meets the 
following project requirements: 

1. Read TWO data sets in with an API (or use two different APIs that have data you can combine to answer new questions). 
NOTE: As previously discussed with Mentors, one source is an API online using the CollegeScorecard API and the other
two sources (CSVs) come from TuitionTracker.org that still  
2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on 
the new data set.  
3. Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
4. Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
5. Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md (only applicable if youâ€™re not 
using a jupyter notebook).
