# College Cost Trend Analyst
A program that helps compare the cost of tuition and graduation rates between years to equip the user with an idea 
of trends. 

This project was made as part of a requirement for CodeLouisville's Data Analysis 2 program and meets the 
following project requirements: 

1. Read TWO data sets in with an API (or use two different APIs that have data you can combine to answer new questions). 
NOTE: As previously discussed with Mentors, one source is an API online using the CollegeScorecard API and the other
two sources (CSVs) come from TuitionTracker.org that still  
2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on 
the new data set.  
3. Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
4. Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
5. Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md (only applicable if youâ€™re not 
using a jupyter notebook).
NOTE: This SHOULD be met by the file you are reading right now! 


Setup 

This program requires two major steps for setup. First, is the setup of a virtual environment. Second, you will 
need to get an API Key from CollegeScorecard.com. 


Virtual Environment 

There are two ways you can go about creating a virtual environment. 

1. Poetry
Poetry uses primarily TOML files to help create a virtual environment and install all necessary

2. VENV
The most common way to create a virtual environment. 


API Key

In order to use this program, you will need to get an API key from the
